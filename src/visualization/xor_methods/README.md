# Advanced XOR Methods

This folder contains scripts and documentation for advanced XOR-based analysis and visualization methods. Each method explores a different aspect of XOR operations on data, revealing patterns, structure, and cryptographic properties.

## Methods Included

1. **Multi-Scale Sliding Window XOR**
   - Run sliding window XORs with multiple window sizes to reveal patterns at different scales.

2. **Diagonal XORs**
   - Compute XORs along both main diagonals to capture diagonal propagation of differences.

3. **Cascading XORs**
   - Apply multiple rounds of XOR operations, using the output of one as the input for the next.

4. **XOR with Shifted Grids**
   - XOR the original grid with shifted versions of itself to highlight changes and edges.

5. **XOR Histograms and Entropy**
   - Compute histograms and entropy of XOR results to quantify randomness and structure.

6. **Bitwise XOR Analysis**
   - Analyze XOR at the bit level, counting bit flips and visualizing bitwise diffusion.

7. **XOR Graphs/Networks**
   - Visualize XOR operations as a network of nodes and edges to show propagation and dependencies.

8. **XOR with Random Masks**
   - XOR data with random or structured masks to test sensitivity and diffusion.

9. **XOR "Fingerprinting"**
   - Generate XOR-based fingerprints or hashes for data integrity and comparison.

10. **Animated XOR Evolution**
    - Animate the evolution of XOR patterns over time or through multiple rounds.
